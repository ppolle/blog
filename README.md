# Personal Blog Application

## By Peter Polle

## Description

THis blogging application allows a writer to create blog posts, edit them and delete them if at all they find the need to do so.

It allows users to:
* Only view the blog posts submitted.
* Comment on blog posts submitted by the writer.
* View the most recent posts.
* Get alerted when a new post is made by joining a subscription.

The application allows the writer(who acts as the admin) to:
* sign in to the blog.
* Create blog from the application.
* Delete comments that I find insulting or degrading.
* Update or delete blogs i have created.

### Prerequisites

The following are needed for the application to run on a local computer:
* python version 3.6
* Flask framework
* Bootstrap v.3
* text editor (atom, VS code or sublime text)
* Web browser
* Admin Login credentials. This allows the admin(writer) to post a blog, delete and edit blogs posted and/orcomments posted by users.
```
## Getting Started
* Clone this repository to your local computer.
* Ensure you have python3.6 installed in your computer.
* From the terminal navigate to the cloned project folder.
* Run ```python3.6 run.py``` code in the terminal to launch.
* In the cloned project, inside the root directory, create a directory and name it virtual.
* From the terminal run ```python3.6 -m venv virtual``` to create a virtual environment from where the application will run from.
* Switch to the virtual environment by entering  ```source virtual/bin/activate``` from the terminal.
* To run the app, type ```./start.sh``` from your virtual environment on the terminal. It will give you a local host link that will open the app on a website. 
* Once inside the application, a user will only be able to view the blogs posted and comment on them.
* To post a blog as a writer, login to the application from the drop down menu at the top right of the page. The default email address is ```petero@example.com``` and default password is ```petero2018```.
* This will then grant the admin access to read/write/edit/delete any blog post/comments by accessing the admin tab that'll direct him/her to the admin rights page.
